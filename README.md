# Discord Nukker / Nuke Bot

#### Made by sefty

## Description

This app is a simple, ready to use Discord server nukker coded by [me](https://fentanyl.recipes).
The only thing you need to use this bot is Node.JS installed on you computer
and access to bot's token. ðŸ¤©

After opening `start.bat` file, provide token of your discord bot. Then there will be displayed
list of servers that the bot is on, where you have to select in which guild you
want to run the bot. After that you're ready to go. Pick what you want to do
using numbers.

## Functions
